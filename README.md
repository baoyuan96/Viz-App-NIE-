VIZ: A live data visualization app to promote classroom engagement and thinking

Break out of the current limitations of existing Classroom Engagement apps such as Mentimeter, Kahoot! and etc.
Limitations are that the data visualization features are almost exclusively Word Clouds and Bar Charts

VIZ app is created with more complex visualization such as Network Graphs & River Plot.

Network graph visualization: co-occurrences/dimensionality reduction. It could be used in a classroom setting to create an ice-breaking session or understanding the participants network and see how connected the students are!

 River Plot visualization: aka Sankey Diagram changes in proportions. It could be used to show budgetting, time expenditure in this example of how participants are spending their time and how they would want to spend it instead visualizing the allocation of such changes.
